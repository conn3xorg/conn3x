# Roadmap

The full roadmap lives at [docs.conn3x.org/roadmap](https://docs.conn3x.org/roadmap). This is the short version. There are no dates, and nothing here works until a [release](https://github.com/conn3xorg/conn3x/releases) says it does.

## Today

- Linux hosts: Rocky Linux, RHEL, AlmaLinux, Fedora, Debian and Ubuntu, tested on every change.
- Windows Server 2022 and 2025 over OpenSSH, in preview: files, access rules, registry, services, features, users and groups, firewall rules, MSI packages, scheduled tasks and IIS, with a tested [Azure example](examples/azure-windows-server).
- 101 official circuits, from nginx and PostgreSQL to k3s, Suricata and a private AI stack, in the [catalogue](https://docs.conn3x.org/circuits).
- The [Circuit Builder](https://conn3x.org/build), which writes a config from the circuits you pick, with host roles, an optional step that creates the servers too, and a link you can share.
- `conn3x convert ansible` for bringing playbooks across, and `conn3x drift` for both layers.
- Any OpenTofu provider, with examples tested end to end on DigitalOcean, Google Cloud and Azure.

## Now

Active Directory on Windows: forests, domain controllers and joining a domain, then a lab that builds a whole domain from one config.

## Next

Network devices: switches, routers and firewalls over their own management interfaces.

## Later

macOS hosts.
